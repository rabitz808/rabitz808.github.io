  <h2 id="taking-ics-314">Taking ICS 314</h2>

<p>Embarking on the journey of ICS 314 has not only acquainted me with JavaScript but has also familiarized me with Semantic UI, React, and Meteor. As someone with limited prior experience in these areas, I found the structure of the course to be exemplary. Starting with the fundamentals and gradually progressing towards more advanced topics allowed for a comprehensive grasp of web development. What’s remarkable is how the concepts we learned in class seamlessly complemented one another, forming a cohesive framework for website development. While these ideas are invaluable for web development, they also hold broader applicability beyond the confines of the web.</p>

<h2 id="development-environments">Development Environments</h2>

<p>In the realm of software development, the choice of development environment serves as a vital catalyst for growth. What I mean by this is that the same development environment can be employed across different programming languages. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed utilizing IntelliJ as my go-to program for compiling source code. Its user-friendly interface and ease of setup make it a reliable companion. Even when I venture into other classes that don’t involve JavaScript, I plan to continue utilizing IntelliJ for its seamless adaptability.</p>

<h2 id="coding-standards">Coding Standards</h2>

<p>Another valuable lesson that resonated with me was the significance of coding standards. By integrating ESLint with IntelliJ, I found it effortless to monitor and enforce code formatting. This practice enhances code readability and facilitates the detection of errors during compilation. Coding standards are not exclusive to JavaScript but can be extended to a myriad of programming languages, be it Python or Lua. Adhering to a coding standard ensures consistency in my work, particularly when tackling larger codebases, and is a principle I will always prioritize.</p>

<h2 id="continuous-growth">Continuous Growth</h2>

<p>As I conclude my journey in ICS 314, I recognize that the knowledge and skills gained extend beyond the confines of web development. The structured approach to learning, the choice of adaptable development environments, and the emphasis on coding standards all contribute to a holistic understanding of software engineering. Armed with this newfound knowledge, I eagerly embrace future endeavors, confident that the lessons learned in this course will continue to shape my path as a software engineer.</p>
